## **Key Elements of a Wireframe**  

Wireframes are **visual guides** that define the basic structure and functionality of a website or application before the final design is developed. They help designers, developers, and stakeholders plan the **layout, navigation, content placement, and functionality** effectively.

### **ðŸ”¹ 1. Layout Structure**  
The **layout structure** defines the **overall arrangement** of elements on the page, ensuring proper spacing, alignment, and readability.  

âœ… **Example:**

ðŸ’¡ **How It Helps:**  
- Ensures a logical **flow of information**.  
- Helps designers create **consistent page templates**.  
- Improves **readability and user engagement**.

### **ðŸ”¹ 2. Navigation**  
Navigation refers to how users **move through the interface**, helping them find information quickly and efficiently.  

âœ… **Example:**  
A **wireframe for an e-commerce site** might include a **top navigation bar** with links to "Home," "Shop," "Cart," and "Profile."  

ðŸ’¡ **How It Helps:**  
- Ensures users **can navigate effortlessly** between pages.

ðŸ’¡ **How It Helps:**  
- Makes the interface **intuitive for users**.  
- Prioritizes **important content** for better engagement.

### **ðŸ”¹ 4. Functionality**  
Functionality defines how **interactive elements** (buttons, forms, dropdowns) work within the interface.  

âœ… **Example:**  
A **login wireframe** includes a **username and password field**, a **â€˜Sign Inâ€™ button**, and a **â€˜Forgot Password?â€™ link** for user access.  

ðŸ’¡ **How It Helps:**  
- Ensures interactive elements **function properly**.
